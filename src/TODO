Bugs:
- intersect loads N-1
- empty query
- empty tokens in intersect crash

Optimizations:
- Don't load offsets in a single token query
- Don't concatenate vectors in intersect. Just drop them and keep the minimal offset maybe
- By score table?
- Reduce skiplist step
- Directly encode tfidf into inverted, to avoid lookups
